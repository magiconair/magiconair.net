##### Frank Schröder, Amsterdam, NL

For the last 20+ years I have been building and working on **distributed
systems** and all aspects related to them including networking, routing,
scaling, tuning, architecture, deployment, tooling, and more. I have also
worked on web and iPhone apps but my passion is with the backend. Nowadays you
would call that a **full-stack engineer** or someone doing **DevOps**.

I love working on complex technical problems with lots of dimensions and detail
and optimize all aspects of it.

I can write software in **Go, Java, Perl, Python, PHP and JavaScript** and have
been doing this for **25 years+**. My C, C++ and Objective-C are a bit rusty
and I have played with C# but not much. **Since 2011, Go is my preferred**
go-to language since I find its minimal footprint liberating.

I have managed teams of experienced software engineers and **performed lots of
interviews** to find them. I have **line management** experience for a medium
sized team (10+ people) and know how to **interact with stakeholders** on product,
deadlines, vision and constraints on a multi-million Euro service with high
visibility and low tolerance for failures. It is gratifying building a team
that works well together and the work at eBay has taught me how to do that.

I have given a number of **presentations** in small and larger venues usually
in front of technical audiences.

I am used to work with people from multiple countries and in different
timezones. During my time at HashiCorp I have **worked remote** from Amsterdam
with a team on the US west coast which worked well.

I am a native **German** speaker but **English** has become second nature. My
**Dutch** is fluent but can still be improved. I have now learned **French**
twice and it can be resurrected but needs some work.

I have written some **open-source** tools of which my load-balancer
[fabio](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio) is the most notable. It solved lots
of problems for us at eBay, has a significant set of users and I am still
actively maintaining it. I have also written a [Go library for Java properties
files](https://github.com/magiconair/properties) and some smaller tools.
Additionally, I have worked at HashiCorp as a maintainer for
[Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul).

For the most part I have worked in the telecommunications and e-commerce sector
but would like to apply my experience in other industries like **Energy, IoT,
Automation, Robotics, Biotech or Logistics**. Preferably **remote, in the
Amsterdam area or somewhere in southern Germany**.

Below you can find more details over my past work experience and you can find
additional details and recommendations from others on my
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/magiconair) profile.
