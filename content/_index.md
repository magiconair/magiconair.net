My name is Frank Schr√∂der and I am a distributed systems engineer.

During my professional carreer I have mostly worked on building large scale
systems.

 * Webraska/AirFlash : Location based services
 * SharpMind : Datacenter setup, provisioning, containers and micro-services

I have written some open-source tools which I am still maintaining:

 * [github.com/gopcua/opcuo](https://github.com/gopcua/opcua) : Pure Go OPC/UA client and server library for industrial applications
 * [github.com/magiconair/properties](https://github.com/magiconair/properties) : properties library for Go

I am the original author of this project but have transferred it to another maintainer

 * [github.com/fabiolb/fabio](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio) : Consul aware load balancer HTTP/TCP reverse proxy ([Website](https://fabiolb.net/))
