My name is Frank Schr√∂der and I am a distributed systems engineer. 

During my professional carreer I've mostly worked on building large scale 
systems.

 * Netscape Professional Services : Email and web-hosting systems
 * Webraska/AirFlash : Location based services
 * SharpMind : Datacenter setup, provisioning, containers and micro-services
 * eBay: micro services, team management, hiring, Go, [fabio](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio)
 * HashiCorp: [Consul](https://consul.io/) maintainer

I have written some open-source tools which I'm still maintaining:

 * https://github.com/magiconair/properties : properties library for Go
 * https://github.com/magiconair/vendorfmt : tool for making `vendor.json` files more merge friendly
