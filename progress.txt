DESIGN DECISIONS
================================================================================

[2026-01-17] Chose terminal-inspired dark theme
- Reasoning: Reflects developer/engineer identity
- Monospaced typography conveys technical expertise
- Dark background reduces eye strain, popular among developers

[2026-01-17] Decided on single-page static HTML
- No build system required (unlike current Hugo setup)
- Faster to load, easier to maintain
- Pure HTML/CSS, no JavaScript dependencies

[2026-01-17] Color palette selected
- Dark background (#0d1117) - GitHub dark theme inspired
- Light text (#c9d1d9) for readability
- Blue accent (#58a6ff) for links
- Subtle borders (#30363d) for structure

LEARNINGS & NOTES
================================================================================

1. Hugo site structure is well-organized but complex for a simple personal site
2. Current theme (theDocs) is documentation-focused, not ideal for portfolio
3. GitHub star counts provide good social proof for projects
4. CV PDF already exists in repo - reuse it
5. Contact page has multiple contact methods - consolidate on homepage
